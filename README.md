# GCP VertexAI-GenAI

-- This code is designed to run in Google Colab, connecting to Google Cloud and using Vertex AI to work with generative models. It begins by installing required packages like google-cloud-aiplatform and ragstack-ai. User-defined environment variables such as PROJECT_ID and LOCATION are retrieved and set, followed by authenticating the GCP project. The Vertex AI platform is initialized to use the Gemini 1.0 model for generating text-based responses to queries, such as asking about the color of the sky. Additionally, it integrates AstraDB for storing embeddings related to image-based queries, utilizing Vertex AIâ€™s MultiModalEmbeddingModel. The code demonstrates generating embeddings for images, inserting them into a vector database, and performing similarity searches for recommendations based on an image input. Finally, it provides product details from a dataset using embeddings for image search and recommendation.
